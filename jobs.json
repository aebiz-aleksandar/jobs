We started the company last year, as we wanted to add a little bit more flavor in our holidays, get away from underwhelming tourist hotspots and get the most out of your vacation.\n\nWe want to add a new feature, where we allow our locals to create a holiday adventure themselves. That may be a ten day cycling track in The Netherlands, a yoga retreat in Thailand or a sailing trip in Croatia. Travelers are able to book this adventure via our website.\n\nWe are looking for someone to help us develop this. We have a clear(ish) idea of what needs to be done (and translated this is in some lo-fi wireframes), but lack the capacity to do it in the short run ourselves.\n\nWe'd love you to share any ideas you may have, all kinds of input are welcome and if you have suggestions on how to make it even better: that's awesome!\n\nWe are a very small team: it's just Matt (our developer) and me (Jesse). We will obviously help you with any questions you may have, but it would be good if you are able to work independently (mostly). That will require you to have at least 5 years of full-stack development. And we are deeply convinced that what we're doing should be fun, so +1 if you are just a nice human being (or other, of course).\n\nIf we are both are happy with the results, we'd love to see whether we can continue our cooperation in further projects and tasks!\n\nWanna score some bonus points?
